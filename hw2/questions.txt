5. You can pass different arguments by sending json data. For example, in slack-interactive, pass whatever json data you want in the spot where I wrote <put json here>.

6. I don’t really know what this question is asking but I am reading it as ‘how to get / use
different inputs’. 

The python command 'json.loads()' converts JSON data to a python dictionary. So you could do anything with the data by doing something like this, as a modification of the skeleton code:

urlstring = urllib.unquote(req).decode(‘utf8’).strip(‘payload=’)
response = json.loads(urlstring)
# assuming the user passes a “name”…
name = response[‘name’]

Or even just print it out, any type of manipulation you want. We could incorporate it back
into the response that is returned by putting it in the data we create.
